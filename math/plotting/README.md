## Synopsis

This repository includes Python scripts that generate line plots, scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and more using the matplotlib library. The scripts also make use of the numpy library to generate and manipulate data.

## File Descriptions

### Mandatory Tasks

- `0-line.py`: This Python script generates a line plot of data. The data is generated using the numpy library and the plot is created using the matplotlib library. The plot includes labels for the x and y axes, a title, and a legend. [Link to the file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/master/math/plotting/0-line.py)

- `1-scatter.py`: This Python script generates a scatter plot of data. The data is generated using the numpy library and the scatter plot is created using the matplotlib library. The scatter plot includes labels for the x and y axes, a title, and a color bar. [Link to the file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/master/math/plotting/1-scatter.py)

- `2-change_scale.py`: This Python script generates a line plot of data with a logarithmic y-axis. The data is generated using the numpy library and the plot is created using the matplotlib library. The plot includes labels for the x and y axes, a title, and a legend. [Link to the file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/master/math/plotting/2-change_scale.py)

- `3-two.py`: This Python script generates a line plot of two sets of data. The data is generated using the numpy library and the plot is created using the matplotlib library. The plot includes labels for the x and y axes, a title, and a legend. [Link to the file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/master/math/plotting/3-two.py)

- `4-frequency.py`: This Python script generates a histogram of data. The data is generated using the numpy library and the histogram is created using the matplotlib library. The histogram includes labels for the x and y axes, a title, and bins of size 10. [Link to the file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/master/math/plotting/4-frequency.py)

- `5-all_in_one.py`: This Python script generates a figure with multiple subplots. Each subplot is a different type of plot (line, scatter, etc.) created using the matplotlib library. The figure includes labels for the x and y axes, titles for each subplot, and a legend. [Link to the file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/master/math/plotting/5-all_in_one.py)

- `6-bars.py`: This Python script generates a bar chart of data. The data is generated using the numpy library and the bar chart is created using the matplotlib library. The bar chart includes labels for the x and y axes, a title, and a legend. [Link to the file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/master/math/plotting/6-bars.py)

### Advanced Tasks

- `100-gradient.py`: This Python script generates a scatter plot of data with a color gradient. The data is generated using the numpy library and the scatter plot is created using the matplotlib library. The scatter plot includes labels for the x and y axes, a title, and a color bar. [Link to the file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/master/math/plotting/100-gradient.py)

- `101-pca.py`: This Python script performs principal component analysis (PCA) on a dataset and generates a scatter plot of the transformed data. The PCA is performed using the sklearn library and the scatter plot is created using the matplotlib library. The scatter plot includes labels for the x and y axes, a title, and a color bar.

## Usage

Each Python script can be run on its own to generate a plot. For example, to generate the plot for `3-two.py`, you would run:

```bash
python3 3-two.py
```
