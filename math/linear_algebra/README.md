#### 1-trim_me_down.py

This script trims down a matrix to its middle rows.

#### 2-size_me_please.py

This script calculates the shape of a matrix.

#### 3-flip_me_over.py

This script transposes a 2D matrix.

#### 4-line_up.py

This script adds two arrays element-wise.

#### 5-across_the_planes.py

This script adds two matrices element-wise.

#### 6-howdy_partner.py

#### 8-ridin_bareback.py

This script performs matrix multiplication.

#### 9-let_the_butcher_slice_it.py

This script slices a 3D matrix along a specific axis.

#### 10-ill_use_my_scale.py

This script calculates the shape of a numpy.ndarray.

#### 11-the_western_exchange.py

This script transposes a numpy.ndarray.

#### 12-bracin_the_elements.py

This script performs element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

#### 13-cats_got_your_tongue.py

This script concatenates two matrices along a specific axis with numpy.

#### 14-saddle_up.py

This script performs matrix multiplication with numpy.

### Advanced Tasks

#### 100-slice_like_a_ninja.py

This script slices a numpy.ndarray along specific axes.

#### 101-the_whole_barn.py

This script adds two matrices of arbitrary dimensions. (once done)

#### 102-squashed_like_sardines.py

This script concatenates two matrices of arbitrary dimensions. (once done)

## Usage

Each script can be run on a Python3.5 standard library and requires numpy 1.15. The scripts can be run in the format `./[script_name].py`.

## Examples

To run the script `0-slice_me_up.py`, use:

```bash
./0-slice_me_up.py
```
