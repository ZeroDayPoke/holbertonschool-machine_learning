# Calculus - Machine Learning

This directory contains various Python scripts and text files related to the study of calculus in the context of machine learning.

## File Descriptions

### Python Scripts

- [9-sum_total.py](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/master/math/calculus/9-sum_total.py): This Python script contains a function `summation_i_squared(n)` that calculates the sum of the squares of all the natural numbers from 1 to n. The function takes in an integer n and returns the sum of the squares of all numbers from 1 to n.

- [10-matisse.py](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/master/math/calculus/10-matisse.py): This Python script contains a function `poly_derivative(poly)` that calculates the derivative of a polynomial. The function takes in a list of coefficients representing a polynomial and returns a new list of coefficients representing the derivative of the polynomial.

- [17-integrate.py](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/master/math/calculus/17-integrate.py): This Python script contains a function `poly_integral(poly, C=0)` that calculates the integral of a polynomial. The function takes in a list of coefficients representing a polynomial and an integer C representing the integration constant, and returns a new list of coefficients representing the integral of the polynomial.

### Text Files

- The remaining files are text files, answers to specific questions posed on the Holberton Intranet, and therefore perhaps of limited value without context.
