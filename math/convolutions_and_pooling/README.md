# Holberton School Machine Learning Mathematics: Convolution and Pooling Project

## Overview

This project involves the implementation of various convolution and pooling operations on images. It focuses on understanding and applying different types of convolutions and pooling techniques using NumPy.

## Files Description

- `0-convolve_grayscale_valid.py`: Performs valid convolution on grayscale images.
- `1-convolve_grayscale_same.py`: Implements same convolution on grayscale images.
- `2-convolve_grayscale_padding.py`: Executes convolution on grayscale images with custom padding.
- `3-convolve_grayscale.py`: Applies convolution on grayscale images with various options for padding and stride.
- `4-convolve_channels.py`: Performs convolution on images with channels.
- `5-convolve.py`: Implements convolution on images using multiple kernels.
- `6-pool.py`: Applies pooling on images.
- `*-main.py`: Main files to test the functionality of each script with sample images and kernels.

## Requirements

- Python 3.5+
- NumPy

## Usage

Each file can be executed individually to test its functionality. For example, to test `4-convolve_channels.py`, run:

```bash
python3 4-main.py
```

## Visualization

The main files include matplotlib code to visualize the original and transformed images.
