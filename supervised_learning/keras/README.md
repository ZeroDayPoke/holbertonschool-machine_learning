# Holberton School Machine Learning Keras Project

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on the application of machine learning techniques using the Keras library in TensorFlow. The repository includes various scripts demonstrating different functionalities in Keras, such as building models, training, testing, handling weights and configurations, and more.

## Project Structure

- `0-sequential.py`: Builds a neural network using the Keras Sequential API.
- `1-input.py`: Function to build a neural network with specific input parameters.
- `2-optimize.py`: Sets up Adam optimization for a Keras model.
- `3-one_hot.py`: Converts a label vector into a one-hot matrix.
- `4-train.py`, `5-train.py`, `6-train.py`, `7-train.py`, `8-train.py`: Different variations of functions for training a model using mini-batch gradient descent.
- `9-model.py`: Functions for saving and loading entire Keras models.
- `10-weights.py`: Functions for saving and loading a model's weights.
- `11-config.py`: Functions for saving and loading a modelâ€™s configuration.
- `12-test.py`: Function to test a neural network.
- `13-predict.py`: Function for making predictions using a neural network.

Each script is accompanied by a corresponding main file (e.g., `0-main.py`, `1-main.py`, etc.) to demonstrate its usage.

## Features

- Building and customizing neural network architectures.
- Training models with various configurations.
- Implementing callbacks such as EarlyStopping and LearningRateScheduler.
- Model serialization and deserialization for weights and configurations.
- Testing and evaluating model performance.

## Usage

Each script is standalone and can be run to demonstrate a specific functionality. Ensure you have TensorFlow and Keras installed in your Python environment.
