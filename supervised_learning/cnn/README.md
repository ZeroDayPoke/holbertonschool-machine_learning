# Holberton School Machine Learning Convolutional Neural Networks Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing. We utilize various techniques such as forward and backward propagation through convolutional and pooling layers, building and training modified LeNet-5 architectures using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Files Description

- `0-conv_forward.py`: Forward propagation over a convolutional layer of a neural network.
- `1-pool_forward.py`: Forward pass over a pooling layer in a neural network.
- `2-conv_backward.py`: Implements backward propagation over a convolutional layer of a neural network.
- `3-pool_backward.py`: Backward pass over a pooling layer in a neural network.
- `4-lenet5.py`: Builds, trains, and validates a modified LeNet-5 neural network model in TensorFlow.
- `5-lenet5.py`: Implements a modified version of the LeNet-5 architecture using Keras.
- `0-main.py` - `5-main.py`: Main files for testing the corresponding Python scripts.
