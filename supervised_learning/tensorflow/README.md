# Holberton School Machine Learning TensorFlow Project

## Project Overview

This project is focused on understanding and implementing various aspects of neural networks using TensorFlow. It covers creating placeholders, forward propagation, accuracy calculation, loss calculation, and training operations.

## Files Description

- `0-create_placeholders.py`: Function to create placeholders for input data and labels for the neural network.
- `1-create_layer.py`: Function to create a layer for the neural network.
- `2-forward_prop.py`: Function to create the forward propagation graph for the neural network.
- `3-calculate_accuracy.py`: Function to calculate the accuracy of a prediction.
- `4-calculate_loss.py`: Function to calculate the softmax cross-entropy loss of a prediction.
- `5-create_train_op.py`: Function to create the training operation for the network.
- `6-train.py`: Function to build, train, and save a neural network classifier.
- `7-evaluate.py`: Function to evaluate a neural network's predictions.
- `0-main.py` to `7-main.py`: Main files for testing the corresponding Python scripts.
