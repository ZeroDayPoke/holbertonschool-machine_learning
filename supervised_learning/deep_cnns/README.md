# Holberton School Machine Learning Deep CNNs Project

## Overview

This project is centered around building deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes the implementation of popular architectures like Inception Network, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-121.

## Files Description

- `0-inception_block.py`: Constructs an inception block for the Inception Network.
- `1-inception_network.py`: Builds the entire Inception Network.
- `2-identity_block.py`: Implements the identity block for ResNet-50.
- `3-projection_block.py`: Creates a projection block for ResNet-50.
- `4-resnet50.py`: Constructs the full ResNet-50 architecture.
- `5-dense_block.py`: Builds a dense block for the DenseNet-121 architecture.
- `6-transition_layer.py`: Creates a transition layer for DenseNet-121.
- `7-densenet121.py`: Constructs the full DenseNet-121 architecture.
- `*-main.py`: Main files to demonstrate the functionality of each script.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.5+
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Usage

Each file can be run individually to demonstrate the specific functionality. For example, to test `4-resnet50.py`, execute:

```bash
python3 4-main.py
```
