# Machine Learning Classification Project

## Description

This project involves the implementation and training of deep neural networks for classification tasks. The primary focus is on binary classification using various neural network architectures, including both single neurons and deeper neural network structures. The project explores forward propagation, cost calculation, evaluation, and gradient descent algorithms.

### Files and Functionality

1. **Neuron Classes (`1-neuron.py`, `2-neuron.py`, etc.)**: Define single neuron performing binary classification with methods for forward propagation, cost calculation, and evaluation.
2. **Neural Network Classes (`11-neural_network.py`, `12-neural_network.py`, etc.)**: Implement neural network models with one hidden layer, including forward propagation, cost calculation, evaluation, and gradient descent.
3. **Deep Neural Network Classes (`20-deep_neural_network.py`, `21-deep_neural_network.py`, etc.)**: Create deep neural network architectures with multiple layers, including forward propagation, cost calculation, evaluation, gradient descent, and training functions.
4. **Utility Functions (`24-one_hot_encode.py`, `25-one_hot_decode.py`)**: Provide methods for one-hot encoding and decoding of labels.
5. **Main Files (`22-main.py`, `23-main.py`, `25-main.py`, etc.)**: Contain scripts to test and demonstrate the functionality of neuron and neural network classes with training and prediction tasks on given datasets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.5+
- NumPy library

## Setup
